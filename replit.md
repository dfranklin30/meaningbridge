# MeaningBridge

A warm, trauma-informed grief-support web app: Continuing Bonds and Meaning Reconstruction (Neimeyer) AI companions, journaling with prompts, self-guided practices, a self-assessment dashboard, a profile of the deceased loved one, a therapist locator, and crisis safety resources.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run the API server (proxied at `/api`)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/meaningbridge run dev` — run the web app (proxied at `/`)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from the OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts run seed-practices` — seed/upsert the canonical practices (by slug), including breath-pacer patterns for breathwork practices
- Required env: `DATABASE_URL` (Postgres), Anthropic via Replit AI Integrations

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui + wouter + TanStack Query + framer-motion + recharts
- API: Express 5 (SSE streaming for chat)
- DB: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- Validation: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- API codegen: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- AI: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 via `@workspace/integrations-anthropic-ai`

## Where things live

- DB schema: `lib/db/src/schema.ts`
- API contract: `lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`
- Generated client hooks: `lib/api-client-react/src/generated/api.ts`
- API routes: `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/` (anthropic, profile, chat, journal, assessments, practices, resources, dashboard, safety)
- System prompts (Continuing Bonds + Meaning Reconstruction): `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/prompts.ts`
- Web pages: `artifacts/meaningbridge/src/pages/`
- Shared layout, header, crisis affordance, onboarding gate: `artifacts/meaningbridge/src/components/layout.tsx`
- Theme tokens, fonts: `artifacts/meaningbridge/src/index.css`

## Architecture decisions

- Single-user MVP. No auth. Profile is a single auto-created row.
- Chat streams via SSE (`text/event-stream`) using `anthropic.messages.stream` and `content_block_delta` events. The client uses `fetch` + manual `ReadableStream` parsing of `data: {json}` frames with event types `delta | crisis | done | error`.
- Crisis detection runs on every user message. Matches log a `safety_event` and surface a soft, non-alarming card linking to `/crisis`.
- Onboarding gate lives in the shared layout: if `profile.onboardingComplete === false`, redirect to `/onboarding` (except `/onboarding` and `/crisis`).
- Drizzle `deceased.lossDate` uses `mode: "string"` and the profile route normalizes Zod-coerced `Date` back to ISO date strings before insert.

## Clinical model (GIS + tier routing)

- GIS = Grief Impairment Scale (Lee & Neimeyer, Death Studies 2022). 5 items, 0-4 days-per-30 scale, total 0-20. Public domain with citation.
- Tier mapping (configurable in `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/clinical.ts`): 0-4 Universal, 5-8 Targeted, ≥9 Clinical (validated cut-score).
- Safety triggers escalate regardless of total: GIS item 3 ≥ 2 (self-destructive coping) and item 5 ≥ 3 (social withdrawal). Both log a `safety_event` and divert the onboarding flow to a calm crisis prompt — never silently scored.
- Companion system prompts in `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/prompts.ts` are tier-aware (Section D of the build spec). They receive `{ profile, deceased }` and inject `firstName` + tier-specific behavior. Hard limits: never claim to be human/therapist, never name self-harm methods, never state cut-scores to the user.
- UI rule: "shift from numbers to narratives." The tier is surfaced as a warm sentence on the dashboard; the numeric GIS score is never shown to the user.
- Clinical wording lives in two mirrored modules — server (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/clinical.ts`) is source of truth for scoring/tier; client (`artifacts/meaningbridge/src/lib/clinical.ts`) carries item wording and the scale for rendering.

## Product

Public (no onboarding gate, no app chrome):
- `/` — coming-soon landing: headline, "Brought to you by Dr. Robert Neimeyer", QR code linking to `/notify?src=qr`, copy-link, contact line for neimeyer@portlandinstitute.org, link to `/present`.
- `/notify` — public signup form (writes to `notify_opt_ins`). Reads `?src=<label>` for attribution; defaults to `qr`.
- `/present` — full-screen QR for keynote projection.
- `/pricing` — subscription tiers mapped to the GIS tiers (Companion / Enhanced / Specialist). Visual prototype, no Stripe wiring; CTAs route to `/onboarding` or `/notify?src=pricing-*`.
- `/caregiver` — caregiver (therapist) portal preview with sample data. Roster, tier badges, consent indicator, per-patient briefing, safety counts. Clearly labeled "preview with sample data" — no PHI, no real data wired.

The /pricing and /caregiver routes are in the public-routes set in `layout.tsx` so they bypass the onboarding gate, and link to each other plus `/notify` for waitlists.

App (behind onboarding gate, full chrome) lives at `/app` plus: `/onboarding`, `/companion`, `/companion/:sessionId`, `/journal`, `/journal/new`, `/journal/:id`, `/practices`, `/practices/:id`, `/checkin`, `/dashboard`, `/loved-one`, `/therapists`, `/crisis`, `/settings`, 404.

## Notify signups

- Table: `notify_opt_ins(id, email UNIQUE, first_name, role_interest, source default 'qr', created_at)`.
- `POST /api/notify` upserts (returns `alreadySubscribed: true` on duplicate — no error UX). Accepts optional `firstName` (trimmed to first whitespace-delimited token).
- `GET /api/notify` returns the full list for CSV export.
- Two fire-and-forget emails go out on each new (non-duplicate) signup:
  1. **Internal notification** — To: remcrawfordresearch@gmail.com, danielle@techleadershipcommunity.com, neimeyer@memphis.edu. Cc: neimeyer@portlandinstitute.org (on Cc so that mailbox's filters can auto-copy/forward incoming signups). Reply-to = signup email so recipients can reply directly. Includes the first name in the table.
  2. **Confirmation to the signup** — To: signup email. Reply-to = neimeyer@portlandinstitute.org (a real human, not the SMTP sender mailbox). Subject "You are on the list for MeaningBridge". Greeted by first name if provided ("Hello Danielle,"), otherwise "Hello,". Warm copy about the experience being shaped around them and the person they are remembering, signed by "The MeaningBridge team".
- Email is sent via `nodemailer` + Gmail SMTP using `GMAIL_USER` / `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` secrets (the Replit Gmail OAuth connector was dismissed in favor of an app password). Helper: `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/mailer.ts`. The API response never waits on SMTP.
- QR is generated client-side with the `qrcode` npm package (privacy + reliability), encoded as `${window.location.origin}/notify?src=qr` so it works on dev and deployed domains without hard-coding.
- Notification emails embed the MeaningBridge lockup logo inline via `cid:meaningbridge-logo` (nodemailer attachment with `cid`). The PNG is loaded once at startup from `artifacts/api-server/assets/logo.png`.

## Voice & photos (per-user)

- Voice-to-text: shared `VoiceInput` component (`artifacts/meaningbridge/src/components/voice-input.tsx`) used in companion chat (`pages/companion/session.tsx`) and journal editor (`pages/journal/editor.tsx`). Records with `useVoiceRecorder` from `@workspace/integrations-openai-ai-react`, POSTs the blob as multipart field `audio` to `/api/voice/transcribe` (server uses OpenAI STT, `routes/voice.ts`, multer memory 25MB, `requireAuth`), then inserts the returned `.text` into the field for review before send/save. Calm states (recording pulse, transcribing) plus mic-permission-denied and transcription-failure fallbacks. Recording auto-stops on unmount; the stop affordance stays active even while chat is streaming.
- Photo uploads: `PhotoGallery` (`artifacts/meaningbridge/src/components/photo-gallery.tsx`) on the loved-one page, shown only when a deceased profile exists. Uses `useUpload` from `@workspace/object-storage-web` with `basePath` `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}api/storage`. Flow: request presigned URL → PUT to storage → POST `{objectPath}` to `/api/deceased/:id/photos`. Images served at `${BASE_URL}api/storage{objectPath}` (objectPath is `/objects/<id>`). Delete via `DELETE /api/deceased/photos/:photoId`.
- Auth/ACL: object storage upload + private object serving are behind `requireAuth`; serving checks READ via `canAccessObjectEntity` with the Clerk `userId`. Attaching a photo uses `objectStorageService.claimObjectEntity` which refuses to reassign an object already owned by a different user (no cross-user takeover) before setting ACL owner = userId, visibility private. Deleting a photo also deletes the underlying blob (`deleteObjectEntity`) so a previously known URL can no longer serve it. Photos table `deceased_photos(id, userId, deceasedId, objectPath, createdAt)` is scoped to the user with cascade delete (`lib/db/src/schema/deceasedPhotos.ts`).
- Auth is cookie-based same-origin Clerk, so manual `fetch` and the upload hook carry the session automatically — no Authorization header needed (same pattern as the SSE chat fetch).

## Brand assets

- Source PNG with whitespace trimmed: `artifacts/meaningbridge/src/assets/brand/meaningbridge-mark.png` (infinity-bridge mark, 787x340) and `artifacts/meaningbridge/src/assets/brand/meaningbridge-lockup.png` (mark + wordmark, 957x535). Both are RGBA with transparent background.
- `<Logo variant="lockup" size={N} />` renders the full lockup at height `N`. `<Logo />` (default) renders just the infinity mark; pass `withWordmark` to append the serif text wordmark instead of the image lockup.
- Favicon: `artifacts/meaningbridge/public/favicon.png` + `favicon.ico` (multi-size 16/32/48/64), generated from the mark. The legacy `favicon.svg` is no longer linked.
- Open Graph / Twitter card: `artifacts/meaningbridge/public/opengraph.jpg` (1200x630) — cream gradient with centered lockup and serif tagline. Referenced by absolute `/opengraph.jpg` in `index.html`.
- Email notification logo: `artifacts/api-server/assets/logo.png` (a copy of the mark) — loaded at startup and embedded inline with `cid:meaningbridge-logo`.

## User preferences

- NO emojis anywhere in UI. None.
- Calm, restful tone. No gamification, no exclamation points.
- Playfair Display for display, DM Sans for body.
- Tasteful slow motion (framer-motion fades). No bounce, no overshoot.
- Persistent crisis-support affordance on every screen.

## Gotchas

- Express 5: route handlers must use `res.status(...).json(...); return;` pattern, not `return res.status(...)`.
- All Tailwind/PostCSS `@import` lines must come before `@plugin` and `@custom-variant` in `index.css`.
- Frontend fetches must prefix URLs with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` (the artifact base path).
